# describes the concept of distributed builds in Jenkins

Distributed builds in Jenkins is a great start for protecting the Jenkins controller from malicious (or just broken) build scripts.

# By default, Jenkins run its builds on the built-in node. It is done to make smooth transition towards learning Jenkins but is inadvisable in long term.
It is due to the fact that any builds running on the built-in node have the same level of access to the controller file system as the Jenkins process.


# Configure Jenkins to prevent builds from running on the Built-In Node directly?
Navigate to Manage Jenkins Â» Manage Nodes and Clouds screen and change the number of Executors to 0 for the Built-In Node.
